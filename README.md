# SecurityHelperWithLogin
A little webapp I built for use with penetration engagements.  Similar to the OSCP helper, but with a login screen, and a little mysql database backing it up
Don't actually use this if you need the login to be secure.  It is not!
but it you're bored, as an exercise, try to figure out how to bypass it, you might learn something.
